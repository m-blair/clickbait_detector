# clickbait_detector
This project uses machine learning to determine an article as 'clickbait' or not, based on its title. This has implications for use in spam detection, and for filtering in web scraping. The dataset used in training the model was obtained via Kaggle, linked [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/clickbait-dataset?select=clickbait_data.csv).
